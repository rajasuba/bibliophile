The objective is to create an android app which just keep a note of whatever the URL which I give it to it in a smart way. 

<b> Requirements </b>

1. It should provide me the option to maintain the archieve of urls (which i've read and personally liked it a lot). 
2. It should allow me to add tags for the url which i add and which i would like to archieve
3. If possible it should crawl the link content and provide something like a sub list (should be smart enough to filter unwanted URL's here)
4. The URL which I provide can be a blog URL or a profile URL (if it's a profile URL then it should crawl all the URL's in his profile and add it to the list)
5. If there is some video content attached to the URL then it should associate it with a video library (if not needed it should allow me to delete it from UI in an easier way)
